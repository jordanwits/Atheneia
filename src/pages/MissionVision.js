                Aletheia was born from the conviction that complete healing is part of God's design and that the truth of God's word—not man made systems—is what sets people free. After decades in the healthcare world and witnessing how often people are cycled through treatments without addressing the spiritual and emotional roots of their suffering, we saw the need for a Christ-centered approach to health. Aletheia exists to help individuals hear God's voice, renew their beliefs with truth, and step into the healing and restoration that Christ has already provided—bringing this message to individuals, families, workplaces, and even prisons.
